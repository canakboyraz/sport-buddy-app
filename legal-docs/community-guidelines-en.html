    <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 4, 2024</p>

    <p>At Sport Buddy, we are committed to building a safe, inclusive, and respectful community for sports enthusiasts.

            identity. Welcome new players and help them feel comfortable.</li>
        <li><strong>No Harassment:</strong> Do not engage in unwanted contact, stalking, or aggressive behavior towards
            other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Safety First</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Safety:</strong> When meeting for sports sessions, prioritize your safety. Meet in public
            places and let someone know where you are going.</li>

            in an immediate ban.</li>

        <li><strong>Truthfulness:</strong> Provide accurate information in your profile and session details. Do not
            impersonate others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Fair Play</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Show Up:</strong> If you join a session, make every effort to attend. If you cannot make it, leave
            the session in the app as soon as possible to allow others to join.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest Ratings:</strong> Rate other users fairly and honestly based on their behavior and
            sportsmanship.</li>
    </ul>
